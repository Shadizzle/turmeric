# Turmeric

Deferred execution, with dependencies.

Turmeric is a small tool for partially applying functions with named arguments,
in the form of maps. It provides a macro, `defer`, that accepts a symbol as a name,
the required named arguments and the form to be executed once all arguments
have been applied. It also provides a function, `spice`, which accepts only
the required arguments and the form to be executed and returns an anonymous function.

## Examples

Returns immediately upon receiving all necessary arguments.
```
(defer deferred-db-func [system table flags]
  (let [{db :db} system]
    (some-db-func db table flags)))

(def db-func-with-system
  (deferred-db-func {:system system}))

(db-func-with-system {:table "users", :flags {})
;; returns the result of some-db-func
```

Wrap in an anonymous function to be called later
```
(defer deferred-db-func [system table]
  (let [{db :db} system]
    (fn [flags]
      (some-db-func db table flags))))

(def give-me-flags
  (deffered-db-func {:system system, :table "users"}))
;; returns a function that expects the flags argument

(give-me-flags {:order-by-age true})
;; returns the result of some-db-func
```
